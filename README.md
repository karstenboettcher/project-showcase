# Project Showcase: Karsten Boettcher
- MovieDB: Concept app build in React Native to communicate with TMDb and provide users a searchable list of movies.
- Tetris: A Tetris clone built using HTML5 and JavaScript, complete with an idle mode AI.
- AWS Widget Handler: A proof-of-concept RESTful widget request handler that processes dummy HTTP requests through AWS Lambda and places them into an SQS queue. The 'consumer' program grabs requests from an SQS queue, processes them, and places them into an S3 bucket or DynamoDB table, as desired by the user.
